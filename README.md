# Social Computing Projects

This repository contains coursework completed for the **Social Computing** course at the **University of Oulu**.

The projects explore how social platforms work from a data, algorithmic, and design perspective, including network analysis, platform growth, content moderation, recommendation systems, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and social feature design.

All projects are implemented using **Python**, **SQL**, and **SQLite**, with additional libraries such as **NLTK**, **Gensim**, and **Flask** where appropriate.

## Project Overview

### Project 1 – Social Network Database Analysis
**Folder:** `Project-1-Social-Network-Database-Analysis`

This project analyzes the structure of a social network stored in an SQLite database.  
It focuses on users, posts, comments, reactions, and relationships, using SQL queries and Python to explore interaction patterns and platform behavior.

### Project 2 – Platform Growth, Virality, and User Interactions
**Folder:** `Project-2-Platform-Growth-Virality-and-User-Interactions`

This project studies platform-scale behavior, including:
- Growth and capacity estimation
- Content virality metrics
- Engagement lifecycle of posts
- Strong user interaction pairs

---

### Project 3 – Moderation, Risk Analysis, and Recommendation Systems
**Folder:** `Project-3-Moderation-Risk-Recommendation`

This project focuses on platform safety and personalization, including:
- Automated content moderation and censorship
- User risk scoring and analysis
- A simple keyword-based recommendation algorithm

---

### Project 4 – Topic Modeling, Sentiment, and Platform Design
**Folder:** `Project-4-Topic-Modeling-Sentiment-and-Platform-Design`

This project combines data analysis and platform design:
- Topic modeling using **LDA (Gensim)**
- Sentiment analysis using **VADER**
- Analysis of sentiment variation across topics
- Design and implementation of a new social feature (Mini Social)

**Note:**  
Datasets from the course-provided *Mini Social* platform are **not included** in this repository due to course privacy and usage restrictions. All analysis code and explanations are provided for transparency and reproducibility.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SQLite / SQL
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK (VADER)
- Gensim (LDA)
- Flask (Mini Social feature extension)
