# Project 4 – Topics, Sentiment, and Platform Design

This project is part of the **Social Computing** course at the **University of Oulu**.

Projects 4.1–4.3 focus on data analysis and platform design, while Project 4.4
involves extending the course-provided *Mini Social* platform.

## Data Availability Notice

The datasets used in Projects 4.1 and 4.2 (e.g., `posts.csv`, `comments.csv`)
originate from the course-provided *Mini Social* platform.

Due to course and privacy restrictions, these datasets **cannot be redistributed publicly**.
As a result, they are **not included in this repository**.

All analysis code is provided for transparency and reproducibility using the same
data structure.

## Projects

### 4.1 – Topic Modeling
Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using the Gensim library to identify the
10 most popular discussion topics on the platform.

### 4.2 – Sentiment Analysis
Used VADER sentiment analysis to evaluate the overall emotional tone of posts and
comments and to study sentiment variation across topics.

### 4.3 – Learning from Others’ Mistakes
Analyzed real-world failures from Facebook and Twitter and proposed concrete
design improvements for Mini Social.

### 4.4 – Social Feature Design and Implementation
Designed and implemented a user reputation and leaderboard feature in the
course-provided Mini Social platform.

Due to platform redistribution restrictions, the implementation code for Project 4.4
is maintained in the following forked repository:
